      "The Project Gutenberg eBook of Peter Pan, by James M.\n",
      "The way Mr.\n",
      "The gaiety of those romps!\n",
      "And gayest of all was Mrs.\n",
      "The name stood out in bolder letters than\n",
      "any of the other words, and as Mrs.\n",
      "The fire was warm, however, and the nursery dimly lit by three\n",
      "night-lights, and presently the sewing lay on Mrs.\n",
      "The dream by itself would have been a trifle, but while she was\n",
      "dreaming the window of the nursery blew open, and a boy did drop on the\n",
      "floor.\n",
      "The opportunity came a week later, on that never-to-be-forgotten\n",
      "Friday.\n",
      "The romp had ended with the appearance of Nana, and most unluckily Mr.\n",
      "The point is, that there is more\n",
      "in my glass than in Michaelâs spoon.\n",
      "The children wept, and Nana ran to him beseechingly, but he waved her\n",
      "back.\n",
      "The loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him.\n",
      "The only sound I hear,â said Wendy, âis like a tinkle of bells.\n",
      "The sound came from the chest of drawers, and Peter made a merry face.\n",
      "The awful\n",
      "thing was that Peter thought this funny.\n",
      "The big gun?â\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes.\n",
      "The pirates had fired Long Tom at them.\n",
      "The roar of it echoed through the mountains, and the echoes seemed to\n",
      "cry savagely, âWhere are they, where are they, where are they?â\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus sharply did the terrified three learn the difference between an\n",
      "island of make-believe and the same island come true.\n",
      "The fairies take\n",
      "an hour longer in the morning, the beasts attend to their young, the\n",
      "redskins feed heavily for six days and nights, and when pirates and\n",
      "lost boys meet they merely bite their thumbs at each other.\n",
      "The lost boys were out looking for Peter, the pirates were out\n",
      "looking for the lost boys, the redskins were out looking for the\n",
      "pirates, and the beasts were out looking for the redskins.\n",
      "The boys on the island vary, of\n",
      "course, in numbers, according as they get killed and so on; and when\n",
      "they seem to be growing up, which is against the rules, Peter thins\n",
      "them out; but at this time there were six of them, counting the twins\n",
      "as two.\n",
      "The first to pass is Tootles, not the least brave but the most\n",
      "unfortunate of all that gallant band.\n",
      "The boys vanish in the gloom, and after a pause, but not a long pause,\n",
      "for things go briskly on the island, come the pirates on their track.\n",
      "The only sound to be heard is their somewhat heavy\n",
      "breathing.\n",
      "The fact is that they are all a little fat just now after\n",
      "the heavy gorging, but in time they will work this off.\n",
      "The redskins disappear as they have come like shadows, and soon their\n",
      "place is taken by the beasts, a great and motley procession: lions,\n",
      "tigers, bears, and the innumerable smaller savage things that flee from\n",
      "them, for every kind of beast, and, more particularly, all the\n",
      "man-eaters, live cheek by jowl on the favoured island.\n",
      "The crocodile passes, but soon the boys appear again, for the\n",
      "procession must continue indefinitely until one of the parties stops or\n",
      "changes its pace.\n",
      "The first to fall out of the moving circle was the boys.\n",
      "The flag oâ skull and bones,\n",
      "A merry hour, a hempen rope,\n",
      "    And hey for Davy Jones.\n",
      "The pirates disappeared among the trees, and in a moment their Captain\n",
      "and Smee were alone.\n",
      "The pirates looked at each other.\n",
      "The pirates listened grimly, and then replaced the\n",
      "mushroom.\n",
      "The crocodile!â he gasped, and bounded away, followed by his boâsun.\n",
      "The tongues of the pursuers were\n",
      "hanging out; the baying of them was horrible.\n",
      "The next moment is the long\n",
      "one, but victory came quickly, for as the boys advanced upon them in\n",
      "the terrible attitude, the wolves dropped their tails and fled.\n",
      "The jealous\n",
      "fairy had now cast off all disguise of friendship, and was darting at\n",
      "her victim from every direction, pinching savagely each time she\n",
      "touched.\n",
      "The Wendy lady lives.\n",
      "The astounded brothers were dragged away to hack and hew and carry.\n",
      "The difference between him and the other boys at such a time was that\n",
      "they knew it was make-believe, while to him make-believe and true were\n",
      "exactly the same thing.\n",
      "The littlest ever seen,\n",
      "With funny little red walls\n",
      "    And roof of mossy green.\n",
      "The babes are at the door,\n",
      "We cannot make ourselves, you know,\n",
      "    âCos weâve been made before.\n",
      "The house was quite beautiful, and no doubt Wendy was very cosy\n",
      "within, though, of course, they could no longer see her.\n",
      "The little house was so pleased to\n",
      "have such a capital chimney that, as if to say thank you, smoke\n",
      "immediately began to come out of the hat.\n",
      "The door opened and a lady came out.\n",
      "The little house looked so cosy and safe in the\n",
      "darkness, with a bright light showing through its blinds, and the\n",
      "chimney smoking beautifully, and Peter standing on guard.\n",
      "The bed was tilted against the wall by day, and let down\n",
      "at 6:30, when it filled nearly half the room; and all the boys slept in\n",
      "it, except Michael, lying like sardines in a tin.\n",
      "The couch,\n",
      "as she always called it, was a genuine Queen Mab, with club legs; and\n",
      "she varied the bedspreads according to what fruit-blossom was in\n",
      "season.\n",
      "The cooking, I can tell you, kept her nose to the\n",
      "pot, and even if there was nothing in it, even if there was no pot, she\n",
      "had to keep watching that it came aboil just the same.\n",
      "The other boys thought this awfully interesting, and insisted on\n",
      "joining, and they made slates for themselves, and sat round the table,\n",
      "writing and thinking hard about the questions she had written on\n",
      "another slate and passed round.\n",
      "The Characters of Father and Mother\n",
      "compared.\n",
      "The difficulty is which one to choose.\n",
      "The extraordinary upshot of this adventure wasâbut we have not decided\n",
      "yet that this is the adventure we are to narrate.\n",
      "The best way will be to toss\n",
      "for it.\n",
      "The children often spent long summer days on this lagoon, swimming or\n",
      "floating most of the time, playing the mermaid games in the water, and\n",
      "so forth.\n",
      "The most haunting time at which to see them is at the turn of the moon,\n",
      "when they utter strange wailing cries; but the lagoon is dangerous for\n",
      "mortals then, and until the evening of which we have now to tell, Wendy\n",
      "had never seen the lagoon by moonlight, less from fear, for of course\n",
      "Peter would have accompanied her, than because she had strict rules\n",
      "about every one being in bed by seven.\n",
      "The bubbles of many\n",
      "colours made in rainbow water they treat as balls, hitting them gaily\n",
      "from one to another with their tails, and trying to keep them in the\n",
      "rainbow till they burst.\n",
      "The goals are at each end of the rainbow, and\n",
      "the keepers only are allowed to use their hands.\n",
      "The rock was\n",
      "not much larger than their great bed, but of course they all knew how\n",
      "not to take up much room, and they were dozing, or at least lying with\n",
      "their eyes shut, and pinching occasionally when they thought Wendy was\n",
      "not looking.\n",
      "The others came closer to him.\n",
      "The order came sharp and incisive.\n",
      "The boat drew nearer.\n",
      "The captain!â said the pirates, staring at each other in surprise.\n",
      "The real Hook was also in the water.\n",
      "The two pirates were very curious to know what had brought their\n",
      "captain to them, but he sat with his head on his hook in a position of\n",
      "profound melancholy.\n",
      "The gameâs up,â he cried, âthose boys have found a mother.\n",
      "The nest must have fallen into the water, but would the\n",
      "mother desert her eggs? No.\n",
      "The fight was short and sharp.\n",
      "The dinghy drifted away.\n",
      "The corkscrew of Smee got Tootles in the fourth rib,\n",
      "but he was himself pinked in turn by Curly.\n",
      "The others were all brave boys, and they must not be blamed for backing\n",
      "from the pirate captain.\n",
      "The rock was slippery as a ball, and they had to crawl rather\n",
      "than climb.\n",
      "The rock was very small now; soon it would be submerged.\n",
      "The last sound Peter heard before he was quite alone were the mermaids\n",
      "retiring one by one to their bedchambers under the sea.\n",
      "The Never bird became irritated; they have very short tempers.\n",
      "The bird covered her face with her wings, so as not to see\n",
      "the last of them; but she could not help peeping between the feathers.\n",
      "The children had discovered the glittering hoard, and\n",
      "when in a mischievous mood used to fling showers of moidores, diamonds,\n",
      "pearls and pieces of eight to the gulls, who pounced upon them for\n",
      "food, and then flew away, raging at the scurvy trick that had been\n",
      "played upon them.\n",
      "The stave was still there, and on it Starkey had hung\n",
      "his hat, a deep tarpaulin, watertight, with a broad brim.\n",
      "The Never bird saw at once what he was up to, and screamed her\n",
      "admiration of him; and, alas, Peter crowed his agreement with her.\n",
      "The great white father,â he would say to them in a very lordly manner,\n",
      "as they grovelled at his feet, âis glad to see the Piccaninny warriors\n",
      "protecting his wigwam from the pirates.\n",
      "The day,\n",
      "as if quietly gathering its forces, had been almost uneventful, and now\n",
      "the redskins in their blankets were at their posts above, while, below,\n",
      "the children were having their evening meal; all except Peter, who had\n",
      "gone out to get the time.\n",
      "The way you got the time on the island was to\n",
      "find the crocodile, and then stay near him till the clock struck.\n",
      "The meal happened to be a make-believe tea, and they sat around the\n",
      "board, guzzling in their greed; and really, what with their chatter and\n",
      "recriminations, the noise, as Wendy said, was positively deafening.\n",
      "The hateful telling broke out again.\n",
      "The twins began with cheese-cakes.\n",
      "The first twin came to Peter.\n",
      "The stories they told, before it was time for Wendyâs\n",
      "good-night story! Even Slightly tried to tell a story that night, but\n",
      "the beginning was so fearfully dull that it appalled not only the\n",
      "others but himself, and he said gloomily:\n",
      "\n",
      "âYes, it is a dull beginning.\n",
      "The gentlemanâs name,â Wendy continued, âwas Mr.\n",
      "The toads!\n",
      "\n",
      "Still it is best to be careful; and no one knows so quickly as a child\n",
      "when he should give in.\n",
      "The invitation was meant specially for Peter, but each of the boys was\n",
      "thinking exclusively of himself, and at once they jumped with joy.\n",
      "The awful cynicism of this made an uncomfortable impression, and most\n",
      "of them began to look rather doubtful.\n",
      "The pirate attack had been a complete surprise: a sure proof that the\n",
      "unscrupulous Hook had conducted it improperly, for to surprise redskins\n",
      "fairly is beyond the wit of the white man.\n",
      "The white men have in the meantime made a rude stockade on\n",
      "the summit of yonder undulating ground, at the foot of which a stream\n",
      "runs, for it is destruction to be too far from water.\n",
      "The cry is\n",
      "answered by other braves; and some of them do it even better than the\n",
      "coyotes, who are not very good at it.\n",
      "The Piccaninnies, on their part, trusted implicitly to his honour, and\n",
      "their whole action of the night stands out in marked contrast to his.\n",
      "The nightâs work was not yet over, for it was not the redskins he had\n",
      "come out to destroy; they were but the bees to be smoked, so that he\n",
      "should get at the honey.\n",
      "The truth is that there was a something about\n",
      "Peter which goaded the pirate captain to frenzy.\n",
      "The question now was how to get down the trees, or how to get his dogs\n",
      "down? He ran his greedy eyes over them, searching for the thinnest\n",
      "ones.\n",
      "The pandemonium\n",
      "above has ceased almost as suddenly as it arose, passed like a fierce\n",
      "gust of wind; but they know that in the passing it has determined their\n",
      "fate.\n",
      "The pirates, listening avidly at the mouths of the trees, heard the\n",
      "question put by every boy, and alas, they also heard Peterâs answer.\n",
      "The tom-tom,â the miscreants heard Peter cry; âan Indian victory!â\n",
      "\n",
      "The doomed children answered with a cheer that was music to the black\n",
      "hearts above, and almost immediately they repeated their good-byes to\n",
      "Peter.\n",
      "The more quickly this horror is disposed of the better.\n",
      "The first to\n",
      "emerge from his tree was Curly.\n",
      "The pirates kicked him in their rage, just as\n",
      "you kick the parcel (though in fairness you should kick the string);\n",
      "and strange to say it was Hook who told them to belay their violence.\n",
      "The children were flung\n",
      "into it, four stout pirates raised it on their shoulders, the others\n",
      "fell in behind, and singing the hateful pirate chorus the strange\n",
      "procession set off through the wood.\n",
      "The first thing he did on finding himself alone in the fast falling\n",
      "night was to tiptoe to Slightlyâs tree, and make sure that it provided\n",
      "him with a passage.\n",
      "The man was not wholly evil; he\n",
      "loved flowers (I have been told) and sweet music (he was himself no\n",
      "mean performer on the harpsichord); and, let it be frankly admitted,\n",
      "the idyllic nature of the scene stirred him profoundly.\n",
      "The red in his eye had caught sight of Peterâs\n",
      "medicine standing on a ledge within easy reach.\n",
      "The light guttered and went out, leaving the tenement\n",
      "in darkness; but still he slept.\n",
      "The cup was poisoned.\n",
      "The clapping stopped suddenly; as if countless mothers had rushed to\n",
      "their nurseries to see what on earth was happening; but already Tink\n",
      "was saved.\n",
      "The moon was riding in a cloudy heaven when Peter rose from his tree,\n",
      "begirt with weapons and wearing little else, to set out upon his\n",
      "perilous quest.\n",
      "The morning was needed to search for such guidance, and he could\n",
      "not wait.\n",
      "The upper world had called him, but would give no help.\n",
      "The crocodile passed him, but not another living thing, not a sound,\n",
      "not a movement; and yet he knew well that sudden death might be at the\n",
      "next tree, or stalking him from behind.\n",
      "The unhappy Hook was as impotent as he was damp, and he fell forward\n",
      "like a cut flower.\n",
      "The wretched prisoners were dragged from the hold, all except Wendy,\n",
      "and ranged in line in front of him.\n",
      "The infuriated pirates buffeted them in the mouth; and Hook roared out,\n",
      "âThat seals your doom.\n",
      "The sound came steadily nearer; and in advance of it came this ghastly\n",
      "thought, âThe crocodile is about to board the ship!â\n",
      "\n",
      "Even the iron claw hung inactive; as if knowing that it was no\n",
      "intrinsic part of what the attacking force wanted.\n",
      "The pirates respectfully cleared a passage for him, and\n",
      "it was only when he brought up against the bulwarks that he spoke.\n",
      "The crocodile was among those who heard the sound,\n",
      "and it followed him, though whether with the purpose of regaining what\n",
      "it had lost, or merely as a friend under the belief that it was again\n",
      "ticking itself, will never be certainly known, for, like slaves to a\n",
      "fixed idea, it was a stupid beast.\n",
      "The crocodile! No sooner did Peter remember it than he heard the\n",
      "ticking.\n",
      "The cabin! Peter was in the cabin! The children gazed at each other.\n",
      "The Italian Cecco hesitated for a moment and then swung into the cabin.\n",
      "The matter wiâ him is heâs dead, stabbed,â replied Cecco in a hollow\n",
      "voice.\n",
      "The cabinâs as black as a pit,â Cecco said, almost gibbering, âbut\n",
      "there is something terrible in there: the thing you heard crowing.\n",
      "The exultation of the boys, the lowering looks of the pirates, both\n",
      "were seen by Hook.\n",
      "The shipâs doomed!â At this the children\n",
      "could not resist raising a cheer.\n",
      "The boys, pretending to struggle, were pushed into the cabin\n",
      "and the door was closed on them.\n",
      "The others\n",
      "drew back and formed a ring around them.\n",
      "The other boys were flying\n",
      "around him now, flouting, scornful; and he staggered about the deck\n",
      "striking up at them impotently, his mind was no longer with them; it\n",
      "was slouching in the playing fields of long ago, or being sent up for\n",
      "good, or watching the wall-game from a famous wall.\n",
      "The lateness of the hour was almost the biggest thing of all.\n",
      "The rest were tars before the\n",
      "mast, and lived in the foâcâsle.\n",
      "The bluff strident words struck the\n",
      "note sailors understood, and they cheered him lustily.\n",
      "The general feeling was that\n",
      "Peter was honest just now to lull Wendyâs suspicions, but that there\n",
      "might be a change when the new suit was ready, which, against her will,\n",
      "she was making for him out of some of Hookâs wickedest garments.\n",
      "The only change to be seen in the night-nursery is that between nine\n",
      "and six the kennel is no longer there.\n",
      "The corner of her mouth, where one looks first, is\n",
      "almost withered up.\n",
      "The window must always be left open\n",
      "for them, always, always.\n",
      "The reason was so simple: âIâm fond of her too.\n",
      "The children waited for\n",
      "her cry of joy, but it did not come.\n",
      "The first twin was the proud one, and he asked, flushing, âDo you think\n",
      "we should be too much of a handful, sir? Because, if so, we can go\n",
      "away.\n",
      "The fairies are to put it\n",
      "high up among the tree tops where they sleep at nights.\n",
      "The kiss that had been for no one else, Peter took quite\n",
      "easily.\n",
      "The bearded man who\n",
      "doesnât know any story to tell his children was once John.\n",
      "The way I flew? Do you know, Jane, I sometimes wonder whether I ever\n",
      "did really fly.\n",
      "The dear old days when I could fly!â\n",
